### Hi there I'm Bilal Hamdanieh!ðŸ‘‹
Greetings from a multifaceted professional who has woven a diverse tapestry of skills and experiences across the domains of bioinformatics, data science, AI development, and more. Whatever your vision is, however complex, share it with me and Ill turn it into a reality!

Studied at the Lebanese American University
- Bachelors in Bioinformatics with High Distinction and Honors
- Master Courses in Data Science
- Minor Courses in Data Analytics

My passion is to harness the vast potential of data to innovate and bring forth solutions that serve
society in diverse fields, from finance, healthcare to lifestyle. With expertise spanning across the
financial tech sector, bioinformatics, general data analytics, and I/O psychology, I am particularly
keen on bridging the gaps between these disciplines to produce results that cater to the dynamic
needs of the modern world.
Areas of Interest:
1. Financial Data Science: Harnessing the power of data to drive innovations in the fintech
sector, from creating intuitive business dashboards to building predictive machine learning
models, expertise in Credit Risk Modeling, Fraud Detection and Customer Segmentation.
2. AI Integration and Framework Development: Specializing in the development and integration of AI technologies, including Text-to-Speech (TTS), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and text-to-text processing for versatile applications. Expertise in crafting custom AI frameworks to enhance app functionalities and user experiences, ensuring seamless interaction between humans and technology.
3. ETL & Data Pipeline Architecture: Designing and implementing robust ETL processes to ensure
seamless data flow, preparation, and readiness for analytics and modeling.
4. Modeling & Algorithm Development: Leveraging machine learning techniques to uncover
patterns, make predictions, and derive actionable insights, particularly within the financial
sector.
5. Data Visualization & Reporting: Creating intuitive, interactive dashboards and visualizations
to represent complex data findings and inform strategic decisions.
6. Big Data Technologies: Using tools and platforms (expertise in Spark) to process, analyze, and
derive insights from vast datasets in real-time.

Data Science Expertise at Lucky Financial (Since August 15th, 2022): Spearheaded the development and deployment of specialized machine learning models for Credit Default and Spend Modeling, enhancing automatic decision-making processes. Championed data integrity and fairness, devised dynamic dashboards for strategic insights, automated workflows via Databricks, and led data collaboration efforts through AWS. Demonstrated exceptional operational efficiency, managing over 200 tasks within a year, showcasing a blend of technical prowess and collaborative success.

Research Contributions at LAU (2019 - 2022): As a researcher, I led the training and testing of advanced ensemble deep learning models, utilizing Keras & TensorFlow. My work focused on both utilizing pre-trained models and developing custom models from scratch, contributing valuable insights and innovations in machine learning and deep learning methodologies.

Educational Impact as a Private Tutor: At the Lebanese American University, I've had the privilege of mentoring students in Data Structures & Algorithms, employing a teaching approach that bridges theoretical concepts with their practical applications. This role allowed me to simplify complex algorithmic theories, making them accessible and relevant to students' future careers in technology. I've tutored people in different countries: UK, Armenia, Georgia, USA.
